# Big-Data-Analytics-and-Data-Visualisation


This work evaluates a complete dataset of Airbnb listings in NYC with the aim of learning about variables that determine the rental rate and availability. Applying data cleaning, feature engineering, and several machine learning models (linear regression and random forest), the study determines the room type and location to be the foremost predictors of price. Findings indicate that a random forest model is more accurate in predicting price than linear regression. The discussion points to the impact on society, which holds immense importance on the accommodation sector in cities and for the residents. The work offers useful insights to policy makers, hosts, and guests to allow informed decision-making to develop in the constantly changing short-term rental environment.
